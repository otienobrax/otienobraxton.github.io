## INTRODUCTION
In this post, I'll walk you through how I completed the MoneyBox:1 vulnhub machine, happy hacking!
## SETTING UP
Download the vulnerable machine from <https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/moneybox-1,653/> and set up in a virtual environment, preferably Virtualbox.
## FINDING OPEN PORTS & SERVICES
A quick nmap scan reveals three services running on the machine.
```bash
[0t@kali ~]$ nmap 192.168.56.3
Nmap scan report for 192.168.56.3
Host is up (0.00077s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT    STATE   SERVICE
21/tcp  open    ssh
22/tcp  open    ssh
80/tcp  open    http
```
### 80/tcp HTTP
The site doesn't reveal much at first glance.

_Website home page_

The next step is to find hidden directories on the site using dirb.
```bash
[0t@kali ~]$ dirb http://192.168.56.3

From the result, there's a hidden directory: /blogs

Finally, a hint;

_Hint on 192.168.56.3/blogs/ source code_

Following the hints and inspecting the source code leads to a Secret Key which might be useful...

### 21/tcp FTP
Next, I tried connecting to the FTP Server using the default FTP anonymous login
```
Username: anonymous
Password: <leave blank>
```
Login to FTP using the above credentials
```bash
[0t@kali ~]$ ftp 192.168.56.3
Connected to 192.168.56.3.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (192.168.56.3:0t): anonymous
Password:
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp>
```

Surprisingly, I'm in!
The ftp server has an image file `/trytofind.jpg`{: .filepath}. Next, extracting hidden data from the image using steghide gives us another file `/data.txt`{: .filepath}.
##
The password for extraction is the Secret Key found on the sites /S3cr3t-T3xt/ source code.

```bash
[0t@kali ~]$ steghide extract -sf trytofind.jpg
Enter passphrase:
wrote extracted data to "data.txt"
```

```text
Hello.....  renu

      I tell you something Important.Your Password is too Week So Change Your Password
Don't Underestimate it.......
                  
```
{: file='/data.txt'}

### 21/tcp SSH
Since I already found a user `renu`, I decided to bruteforce the ssh login password using hydra.

#### The 1st flag
![Desktop View](https://entyllom.sirv.com/Images/flag1.png){: width="972" height="589" }

#### The 2nd flag
Trying to find what else could be on renu's account leads to a 2nd flag.

Having found a second user `lily`, trying to ssh into their account is the first thing that comes to mind. The ssh login doesn't require a password because it uses an encryption key.
## PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
Running `sudo -l` shows that the user `lily` can run `/usr/bin/perl` with root permission.
`/usr/bin/perl` is a path to a perl compiler which can be used for privilege escalation using a perl script `sudo /usr/bin/perl -e 'exec "/bin/bash"'`

The lab requires 3 flags to complete, so one more to finish.

I used `find / -type f -name '*.txt'` to get all text files in the computer instead of moving one directory at a time looking for the final flag.

### The 3rd flag
The final flag is in `/root/.root.txt`{: .filepath} which is a hidden file.

`cat /root/.root.txt`{: .filepath} to get the last flag.

COMPLETED!
